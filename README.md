Uses:

Node v8.9.0 (https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.9.0/) & Gulp v2.2.0

Tip: To make 100% sure that node_modules folder has Read&Write permissions for Gulp to work, create it yourself before npm install.

FYI

# DEVELOPMENT

Code lives under `src/` folder. Do your magic there! 

Install `npm`:

```
npm i npm@5.5.1
```

install all the necessary node-modules:

```
npm install
```

install `gulp`:

```
sudo npm install gulp@2.2.0 -g
```

and once all the above are done, type:

```
gulp
```

To minify everything, type:

```
gulp build
```
